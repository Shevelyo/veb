    <h1><h><b>The Problem</b></h>
<p>Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and other evil corporations out to hoard and sell your most personal data.

    What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our privacy and freedom.
    
    But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s simple:
    An autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage powered by universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation, and end-to-end encryption.
    
    Put even simpler — <b>it’s the internet, completely decentralized.</b>
</p></h1>

<h2><b>We’re in this together! All of our computers and phones join in a network to make the strongest supercomputer the world has ever seen.</b></h2>

<h3><p1>Introducing PiedPiperCoin</p1>

        <p3>Now there's a way to give credit where credit is due. Compute credit, that is! The more you share your device resources, the more PiedPiperCoin you receive.</p3>
        <p4> Whether you're a developer with an app ready for market, or just an Average Joe with a smartphone you'll love all you can do with PiedPiperCoin.</p4>
